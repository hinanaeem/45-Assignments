//Question # 12
//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
 // but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

 let friendArr1 = ["Zimal","Shahvaiz","Hayyat", "Miral","Zarnab"];
 let message = " is a generous person.";
 for (let h=0; h<friendArr1.length; h++){
    console.log(friendArr1[h] + message);
 }
