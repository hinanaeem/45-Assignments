/* Question # 42
Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
 Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase
  the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.*/

  function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void{
    for(const magician of magicians){
        console.log(magician.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + magician.slice(1));
    }
}

const magician: string[] = ["Nadir","Harry","Mike","Henry"];
show_magicians(magician)

function make_great(magicians1: string[]): void{
    for(let I = 0; I < magicians1.length; I++){
        magicians1[I] = magicians1[I]  +   '   the great'
    }
}

const magicians2: string[] = ["Nadir","Harry","Mike","Henry"];
make_great(magicians2)
show_magicians(magicians2)
